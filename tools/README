find-smartpointer.sh <address> <log-file> <binary>
	this script can be used to decode print the initialization address
	of not correctly deleted smart pointers.

	After the normal cleanup the debug intrusive pointer (on linux)
	prints a stack trace for each non-NULL smart pointer, from the
	destructor. However, sometimes the pointer object does not get
	deleted, so the destructor is not called. In this case this script
	can collect the addresses of the pointers to an object that pesists
	persisting Destory(). Each pointer is checked for proper destruction
	and for the undestructed pointers it translates the return address
	of the constructor using addr2line into a file:line location.
